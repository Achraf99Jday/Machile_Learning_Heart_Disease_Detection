Machine Learning classifications methods || Academic

The aim of this project is to study the classification methods to which statistics naturally give access. It will therefore be a question of studying probabilistic classification tools.


- DataBase used : heart disease (Cleveland database)

    This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to this date.     The `target` field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Experiments with the Cleveland database have concentrated on simply attempting to distinguish presence (values 1) from absence (value 0).
